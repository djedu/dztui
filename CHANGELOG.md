# Changelog

## [4.0.2] 2023-11-22
## Fixed
- Query helper not loading: fixed a remote link pointing to the wrong destination and added a checksum verification to ensure file is present

## [4.0.1] 2023-11-22
## Fixed
- Emergency hotfix to remove build artifacts leaking into main script: if you updated DZGUI from 3.3.18 to 4.0.0 between 2023-11-22 15:00:02 and 2023-11-22 15:03:37 GMT, there is a small chance it will be unable to launch correctly. If so, please follow the instructions on the manual to reinstall.

## [4.0.0] 2023-11-22

Hello players, this is a major version update which overhauls many of DZGUI's underlying systems to improve responsiveness of the application and make menus more intuitive to interact with. It should be considerably more difficult, if not impossible, to inadvertently crash a dialog, and nested dialogs should behave in a more expected fashion, such as when going back and forth between menus or changing options dynamically within a given menu.

In addition, with this update we are querying servers directly. The net benefit of this is that results will returned faster, bootup is faster, and it also paves the way for future features like connecting to servers on a LAN. The Battlemetrics API is now entirely optional and can be skipped during the setup process. However, if you have already set up a BM API key, you can continue using it if you want to query or add servers by ID instead of IP.

As part of this change, version 4.0.0 introduces the ability to connect to or add servers to your list based on either ID or IP. Previously, you could only connect by IP and add by IP, but now you can connect by IP/ID or add by IP/ID. If you choose the ID method, this will be translated into an IP seamlessly in the background. Similarly, favorite servers are now stored using the full IP rather than the ID. Due to the variety of systems and methods for connecting to servers, the application was carrying around and converting server IPs, IDs, and other formats back and forth, creating unnecessary complexity. By normalizing everything to an IP basis, maintainability should be more consistent. When upgrading to this version, your old favorites lists will be updated automatically to the new IP method. Note that as a result of this change, we must purge old history lists ("Recent Servers"), but everything else should carry over as before.

If you encounter any problems with this new release or with the migration of configs, please do not hesitate to submit a bug report.

Attention Fedora 38 users: problems with upstream GNOME packages causing crashes have been reported to GNOME development and a fix has been issued. You have the choice of compiling the zenity package 
from source or waiting until the latest version is merged into Fedora's package manager.

## Added
- Change in game name: dynamically change your profile name via the Advanced Options menu
- Connect by ID: supply a Battlemetrics ID to connect to a server; this can be used in lieu of the IP
- Add by IP: supply a standard IP to add a server to your list; this can be used as a more direct way of saving servers
- Filter by 1PP and 3PP in the server browser
- Save connected server to favorites: prior to connecting, asks the user if they want to save this server for future use
- Generate additional output when generating system logs

## Fixed
- Rare cases where the keyword filter would not filter server results correctly
- Handling of dialog exit signals: made it much more difficult to crash the application in rare cases when spamming input or returning from menus
- Update menus in place: when toggling options in the Advanced Options menu, displays the current state/mode of the option for better readability into what option is currently enabled
- More intuitive menu navigation: dialog setup and teardown is more responsive and follows expected flows when inside of nested menus
- Message formatting: fold long messages inside of popup dialogs for proper word wrapping regardless of screen type
- Fixed a rare case where dialogs would spawn twice during first-time setup
- Properly remain inside of menus when looping where it would make sense to do so : e.g., Delete Servers list, Advanced Options

## Changed
- Query servers directly to reduce API hops: initial bootup and subsequent server queries should be considerably faster
- Store complete IP:Port instead of server IDs
- Make Battlemetrics API key optional: this is only used for the 'Connect by ID' and 'Add server by ID' methods and is not required. If you prefer, you can simply connect/add by IP.
- Prevent the application from launching in Game Mode on Steam Deck: Steam Deck's kiosk mode has problems sending keyboard input to third party applications. To prevent unintended usage, DZGUI now warns the user to launch the app in Desktop Mode if they attempt to use it from Game Mode. Adding DZGUI as a Non-Steam Game does work on desktop PCs, but is not recommended due to the way Steam handles subshells. For best results, launch DZGUI directly via the script/applications menu (PC) or via the desktop icon (Steam Deck).
- Omit null servers from list: servers that time out or send an empty response are now omitted entirely from the My Servers list, as they will not return meaningful metadata unless they are online.  
  The My Servers list thus shows online and accessible servers
